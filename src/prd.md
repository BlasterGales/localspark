## Design Direction

### Visual Tone & Identity
- **Emotional Response**: Confidence, focus, efficiency
- **Design Personality**: Clean, professional, developer-centric
- **Visual Metaphors**: Terminal aesthetics, code editor styling
- **Simplicity Spectrum**: Minimal interface with powerful functionality

### Color Strategy
- **Color Scheme Type**: Dark monochromatic with accent colors
- **Primary Color**: Deep blue (#1e40af) - trust and stability
- **Secondary Colors**: Slate grays for structure and hierarchy
- **Accent Color**: Emerald green (#10b981) - success and active states
- **Color Psychology**: Dark theme reduces eye strain for long coding sessions
- **Color Accessibility**: High contrast ratios for readability
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**: 
  - Background (#0f172a) + Foreground (#f8fafc) - 18.7:1 contrast
  - Card (#1e293b) + Card Foreground (#f8fafc) - 15.2:1 contrast
  - Primary (#1e40af) + Primary Foreground (#ffffff) - 8.6:1 contrast

### Typography System
- **Font Pairing Strategy**: Inter for UI, JetBrains Mono for code
- **Typographic Hierarchy**: Clear distinction between headings, body, and code
- **Font Personality**: Technical precision with human readability
- **Readability Focus**: Optimized for code and technical content
- **Typography Consistency**: Consistent sizing and spacing throughout
- **Which fonts**: Inter (400, 500, 600, 700) and JetBrains Mono (400, 500)
- **Legibility Check**: Both fonts are highly legible in dark themes

### Visual Hierarchy & Layout
- **Attention Direction**: Left sidebar for files, center for chat, top for controls
- **White Space Philosophy**: Clean spacing to reduce cognitive load
- **Grid System**: Flexbox-based responsive layout
- **Responsive Approach**: Mobile-first with desktop optimizations
- **Content Density**: Balanced information density for productivity

### Animations
- **Purposeful Meaning**: Subtle transitions for state changes and loading
- **Hierarchy of Movement**: Focus on chat message streaming and file upload feedback
- **Contextual Appropriateness**: Minimal, functional animations that don't distract

### UI Elements & Component Selection
- **Component Usage**: shadcn components for consistency and accessibility
- **Component Customization**: Dark theme with developer-focused styling
- **Component States**: Clear hover, focus, and active states
- **Icon Selection**: Phosphor icons for technical clarity
- **Component Hierarchy**: Clear primary/secondary action distinction
- **Spacing System**: Consistent use of Tailwind's spacing scale
- **Mobile Adaptation**: Responsive layout with collapsible sidebar

### Visual Consistency Framework
- **Design System Approach**: Component-based with consistent spacing
- **Style Guide Elements**: Color tokens, typography scale, spacing system
- **Visual Rhythm**: Consistent padding and margins throughout
- **Brand Alignment**: Technical, professional, efficient aesthetic

### Accessibility & Readability
- **Contrast Goal**: WCAG AA compliance for all text elements (achieved with current color scheme)

## Edge Cases & Problem Scenarios
- **Potential Obstacles**: Ollama connection issues, large file uploads, model loading delays
- **Edge Case Handling**: Graceful error messages, loading states, offline detection
- **Technical Constraints**: Browser file size limits, Ollama API limitations
- **Windows-specific Issues**: Rollup native dependency problems, CORS configuration

## Implementation Considerations
- **Scalability Needs**: Support for multiple concurrent chats, file history
- **Testing Focus**: Ollama integration, file upload reliability, chat streaming
- **Critical Questions**: Model performance impact, file size limitations, security considerations
- **Platform Support**: Windows, macOS, Linux compatibility with specific troubleshooting

## Reflection
This approach creates a focused developer tool that bridges local AI capabilities with project context. The dark theme and technical aesthetic appeal to the target developer audience while maintaining usability and accessibility standards. The addition of comprehensive setup documentation addresses common installation issues, particularly on Windows systems.
